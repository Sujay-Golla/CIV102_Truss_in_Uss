# CIV102_Truss_in_Uss
Team members: Justine Gaw, Sujay Golla, Evelyn Liu, Parrot Xue

**Description:** For the CIV102 Bridge Design project, our team wrote the necessary code to compute different stress values to optimize the cross-section of our beam bridge. We used a coordinate system and rectangles defined with bottom-left and top-right corners. The program also simulates train passes with increasing loads to estimate and pinpoint the location of failure.
